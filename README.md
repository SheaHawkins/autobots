# AutoBots

## Our Mission
The most time consuming part of software development is no longer writing code. It is instead deconstructing tasks and orchestrating their deployment.

Historically, contract-driven development, or [design-by-contract (DbC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract), has been poorly adopted despite some distinct advantages. CDD promises to cleanly architect, test, and document software, however, the activation energy required to implement it is too high for most organizations.

AutoBots aims to solve this problem by providing an open-source, AI-powered platform for achieving CDD at scale.
